# movie_recommendation_system-AIML
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. It involves:

Loading and exploring movie, rating, and tag data.
Preprocessing the data to create a user-item matrix and handling missing values.
Filtering the data to include only movies and users with a sufficient number of ratings.
Building a recommendation model using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm on a sparse representation of the user-item matrix.
Creating a function to get movie recommendations based on a given movie title.
(Optionally) Demonstrating how to deploy the system as a web application using Streamlit.
The goal is to recommend movies to users based on the preferences of similar users.
